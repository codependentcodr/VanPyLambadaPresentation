# Building A Basic Aws Lambda Function Without Frameworks With Python

Talk presented at VanPy in Jan 2019.

This contains the slides I used, and all code samples.

## Repo Contents

The `slides.html` and `framework` folders contain the slides I used.

The `versionXXX` directories have various revisions of the Lambda function I built, and
are referenced in the slides.  Each directory is self-contained, so you should be able
to bundle any one of them up & send to Lambda.
